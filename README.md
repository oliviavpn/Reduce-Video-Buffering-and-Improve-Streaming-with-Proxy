Using a proxy server can help reduce buffering and improve your streaming experience in several ways.

## What Causes Buffering When Watching Movies?

Buffering occurs due to slow or unstable internet connections, network congestion, or geographic distance from the streaming server. When the video player runs out of preloaded data, it must pause and wait for more to download, leading to interruptions.

## How a Proxy Can Improve Your Streaming Experience

A proxy works like a middleman between your device and the internet. By connecting through a proxy, your internet traffic is routed through another server that might be closer to the streaming source or less congested.

This can help by:

- Reducing delays and loading times
- Avoiding slowdowns caused by your internet provider
- Offering a more stable and faster connection

Using a reliable proxy means fewer interruptions and smoother playback, letting you enjoy your favorite movies without the annoying buffering breaks.
